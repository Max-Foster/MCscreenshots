        Bad Graphical is a small, 2 person game development team (my brother and
        I). I like coding, and trying to make video games. But I'm not very good
        at it, so there will be no AAA games or anything like that. I really
        like old video games, and their bad graphics. So why not make more of
        them? So that's why this is called Bad Graphical. Because most of my
        games will have bad graphics (deliberately or not). I hope you enjoy the
        games to some extent, and please give me feedback so I can fix bugs or
        improve the games. Thanks.<br /><br />- BG
