        Who are we? Just a small game dev team located in Australia. We try to
        make enjoyable games with decent graphics. However, we are not perfect,
        so there may be a few low-poly models here and there. If you want a new
        game/feature, or just want to report a bug, please share it with us. We
        love your feedback! Thanks.<br /><br />- Max Foster,<br />&nbsp&nbspfounder
